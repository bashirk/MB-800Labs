Hands-on-Lab 3.1: Set Up Finance Management
===========================================

Exercise 1: Create a new fiscal year
------------------------------------

### Scenario

When setting up the company you were misinformed about Contoso’s fiscal year.
Although they want to use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central as of January
1st 2022, their new fiscal year does not start until July 1st 2022.

You will have to correct this mistake and prepare the accounting periods for the
entire fiscal year.

### Tasks

1.  Change the starting date of the fiscal year.

2.  Create accounting periods in bulk.

### Steps

1.  Change the starting date of the fiscal year.

    1.  Open the **Accounting Periods** page.

    2.  Select the accounting period with starting date 7/1/2022 and select the
        **New Fiscal Year** checkbox.

    3.  Leave the selection on the **New Fiscal Year** checkbox for the
        accounting period with starting date 1/1/2022.

2.  Create accounting periods in bulk.

    1.  In the **Accounting Periods** page, select **More Options**, then select **Actions** and then select
        **Create Year**.

    2.  On the window that opens, fill in the following options:

        1.  In the **Starting Date** field, enter 7/1/2022.

        2.  In the **No. of Periods** field, enter ‘12’.

        3.  In the **Period Length** field, enter 1M.

    3.  Click **OK**.

    4.  New accounting periods are now created, where the last accounting period
        has a starting date of 7/1/2023 and the **New Fiscal Year** checkbox is
        selected.

Exercise 2: Configure the general ledger setup
----------------------------------------------

### Scenario

After setting up the correct accounting periods, you will complete some general
accounting setup.

Contoso is located in the United States and will record their accounting data in
US dollar, thereby respecting the currencies 2 digit decimals for displaying
invoice amounts and amounts. Unit-prices however, can be shown with 2 up to 5
digit decimals.

Once the company’s users will start to record sales and purchase transactions,
the accounting manager wants to make sure they are only processed within the
current accounting period. Make sure the company is set for the first
transactions for January 2022, but also allow your own user to process the
opening balance on December 31st 2021.

### Tasks
